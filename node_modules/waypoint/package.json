  "readme": "# Waypoint\n\nA CoffeeScript URI router for use anywhere. The main aim of\nwaypoint is to decouple the URI parsing from any kind of\nautomatic dispatching.\n\nFor example Director is a JS router that works both client\nside and server side. It listens in the browser for URI\nchanges and runs the route callbacks for any matching routes.\nOn node it can respond to a Request object.\n\nFor waypoint I didn't want to include this behaviour so that\nyou are free to use what ever you want. In the browser you\ncould use History.js. On the server you could use a completely\ncustom solution. It's up to you.\n\n## In the browser\n\nFirst you'll want to clone the git repository like so:\n\n\tgit clone git://github.com/DrPheltRight/waypoint.git\n\tcd waypoint\n\nYou'll find the latest development version of Waypoint for the\nbrowser in the `dist` directory. You can either use this or\nbuild your own like so:\n\n\tcake build\n\nIf you wanted to build the master version you can simply\ncheckout that branch.\n\nNow you can use the browser edition as shown in\n`examples/browser`. It is AMD, CommonJS and global\ncompatible so include it how you wish.\n\n## On the server\n\nYou can use NPM to install waypoint like so:\n\n\tnpm install waypoint\n\nThis will install it into `node_modules` within your current\ndirectory. *You probably wouldn't want to use waypoint\nglobally.*\n\nOnce you have waypoint installed you can require it like\nnormal:\n\n``` js\nvar waypoint = require('waypoint'),\n\trouter = new Waypoint.Router;\n\nrouter.routeMap({\n\t'/' : function () {\n\t\tconsole.log('Index');\n\t},\n\t'/:name': function (name) {\n\t\tconsole.log('Hello', name);\n\t},\n\t'POST /process': function () {\n\t\tconsole.log('POST request');\n\t}\n})\n\nrouter.dispatch('/');\nrouter.dispatch('/Bob');\nrouter.dispatch('POST', '/process');\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you wish to hack on waypoint clone the development branch\nand use `npm link` to ensure your working directory is\nsymlinked into node's include path.\n\n## Author\n\nLuke Morton a.k.a.
